Dear Employer,

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Lilya Stanislavska, and I am a participant of the Prometheus program. I am 25 years old. I have a bachelor's degree in English language, but in recent years, I have been self-learning Python and successfully completed courses in DevOps Kubernetes.

Currently, I am actively seeking an opportunity to gain my first internship in the field of DevOps. My knowledge and skills in this area will allow me to effectively perform tasks, and my willingness to learn and grow will make me a valuable addition to your team.

I am confident that my motivation and readiness to learn will enable me to make a significant contribution to your project. I am ready to join your team and start working together.

Thank you for considering my letter. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss my candidacy with you in person.

Best regards,
Lilya Stanislavska
